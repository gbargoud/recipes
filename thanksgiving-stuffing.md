### Ingredients

- 1.75 lbs sausage meat Pastosa
- 2 12 ounce mushrooms
- 2 cups Celery
- 2 cups Onions
- 3 Apples

- Parsley
- Butter
- Chicken stock large container

### Baking Instructions

1. Bake covered 30 mins at 350
2. Bake uncovered 45 mins at 350

### Instructions

1.You can buy the Italian sausage anywhere and take it out of the casing when you sauté it. Start with the sausage and no oil in the pan and then add sausage to dry cubes and do the same with remaining mushrooms, celery, onions apples (use butter for apples and olive oil for the others)

2. I sauté everything individually in a pan using butter and oil and add it to the dry bread cubes.

3. Last you add the chicken stock about 16 ozs depending on dryness of bread and mix in fresh herbs. Don’t make it too mushy, cubes should keep some of their shape.

4. Then butter a baking pan and cook it as above.
