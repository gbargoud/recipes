# Sourdough Pizza Crust
Makes 2 personal pizzas

### Ingredients
- 1 cup sourdough starter, unfed/discard
- 1/2 cup hot tap water
- 2 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 4 teaspoons spices (optional -- garlic powder, onion powder, etc)

### Instructions
1. Spoon 1 cup starter into a mixing bowl. Add the hot water, flour, salt, yeast, and spices. 
2. Mix to combine, then knead until smooth and slightly sticky, about 7 minutes at medium speed using a stand mixer with dough hook. 
3. Place dough in a lightly greased container, and allow it to rise until doubled (2-4 hours)
4. Divide the dough in half, shaping each half into a flattened disk. 
5. Drizzle two 12" round pizza pans with olive oil, tilting the pans to coat the bottom. Place half the dough in each pan. 
6. Cover, and let rest for 15 minutes. 
7. Press the dough towards the edges of the pans; when it starts to shrink back, cover it, and let it rest again, for about 15 minutes. 
8. Preheat your oven to 450Â°F, and let dough rise while waiting.
9. Pre-bake for 5 minutes.
10. Add toppings, and bake for 10 minutes or until crispy.
